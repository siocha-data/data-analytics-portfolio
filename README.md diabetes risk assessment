# Diabetes Risk Assessment Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing diabetes risk using lifestyle and clinical indicators.  
The analysis was performed using data analytics techniques, with a strong emphasis on data modeling, visualization, and interpretability.

The goal of the project is to identify patterns and high-risk groups associated with diabetic outcomes and to demonstrate the use of Power BI for health-related analytics.

## 🧠 Data Modeling
A star schema was implemented to ensure analytical accuracy and performance:
- **Fact Table:** Health risk observations
- **Dimension Tables:** Person, Glucose, BMI, Lifestyle, Outcome

Single-direction, many-to-one relationships were used in Power BI to maintain model integrity.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- KPI card visuals summarizing key metrics
- Lifestyle risk analysis (calories, physical activity, family history)
- Clinical risk analysis (glucose levels, BMI)
- Risk segmentation using combined attributes
- Interactive filters and slicers
- Clear distinction between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Elevated glucose levels show the strongest association with diabetes
- Higher BMI significantly increases diabetes risk
- Low physical activity amplifies lifestyle-related risk
- Family history increases susceptibility but does not determine outcome alone
- Lifestyle factors remain critical and modifiable risk contributors

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
This analysis is observational and does not imply causation.  
The results depend on dataset assumptions and should not be interpreted as a medical diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
The project demonstrates how data analytics and Power BI can be used to explore health risk patterns and support data-driven decision-making.  
It highlights the importance of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention strategies.
